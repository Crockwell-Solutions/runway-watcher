# Runway Watcher — Product Overview

Runway Watcher is an airport runway hazard detection and monitoring system. It provides a real-time dashboard for tracking hazards (birds, drones, debris, vehicles) detected by cameras positioned around an airport.

Key capabilities:
- Live dashboard with airport overview map, risk scoring, and hazard activity charts
- Camera feed management (online/offline/maintenance status)
- Hazard tracking with severity levels (low, medium, high, critical) and confidence scores
- Alert system with acknowledgement workflow
- Historical data analysis with date-range filtering

The frontend is currently a static prototype with dummy data. The backend (Lambda handlers) is scaffolded but not yet implemented.
